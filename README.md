# hello-world

hello earth-living things, i guess;

'something about myself, mmmhhh, really; i don't think there's anything that important about me; other than that am from another planet, and that the only interesting thing in this your plannet is code, everything else is pretty boring, ha! that's me.

Wait i forgot to mention my name, it's elma, but you can call me friend.
